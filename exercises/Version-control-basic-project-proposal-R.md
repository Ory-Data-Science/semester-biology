Familiarize yourself with the [guidelines for the class project]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/projects).

Set up a new GitHub repository for your class project in the class organization like you did in [Set Up Git]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-set-up-git-R/). This time name the repo `FirstnameLastnameProject`.

Write a 1-2 paragraph project proposal in a `.txt` file. Commit and push it to
your class project repo to submit it for instructor feedback.
